### Platform 🌐
Currently integrated for:
1. **Gitea** *(default)*
2. **GitHub**

---
<br/>

## Current tools 🛠️

Claude can only do these 5 things:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_open_prs` | Lists all open PRs |
| `get_pr_diff` | Gets the code changes of a PR |
| `get_pr_commits` | Gets the commit history of a PR |
| `get_pr_comments` | Reads existing comments on a PR |
| `post_pr_comment` | Posts a comment on a PR |


**Prompts that won't work:**
- `"Close PR #5"` — no close tool
- `"Approve PR #5"` — no approve tool
- `"Assign PR #5 to someone"` — no assign tool

The prompt controls **what Claude thinks and says** — the tools control **what it can actually do**.

> **Tip** - *Add new tools to get things done by Agent Binod*

<br/>

## Getting Started 🚀

Agent Binod can be used in two ways — as a **global CLI tool** (recommended) or **run locally from source**.

<br/>

### Option 1: Global CLI ⚡ *(recommended)*

1. **Setup** 🔧 
   Install globally via npm:

```
npm install -g @smi0001/agent-binod
```

2. **Configuration** ⚙️
   Create a `.env` file in your project directory. Refer `.env.example` for the variables to configure with your tokens (at least one platform need to be configured):

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Gitea configuration (default platform)
GITEA_TOKEN=f631f4axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITEA_BASE=https://git.example.in/api/v1
GITEA_REPO=owner/repo

# GitHub configuration (use --platform=github)
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo

# Optional: base branch used when fetching PR diffs via local git (default: origin/main).
# The agent first tries to diff the PR locally using your cloned repo (faster, no API call).
# Set this to the branch your PRs are merged into, e.g. origin/main or upstream/main.
# If unset or if the local diff fails, the agent falls back to fetching the diff via the platform API.
BASE_BRANCH=

# Optional: max open PRs to fetch per listing (default: 50, GitHub max: 100)
PR_FETCH_LIMIT=

```
 
3. **Execution** ▶️
    Then run from anywhere inside your project:

```
agent-binod "Review PR #1 and post comment"
```
> **Tip**: You can give various variations in your prompt, examples are given below under `Usage` title

4. **Updating** 🔄
   When a new version is published, update your global install:

```
npm install -g @smi0001/agent-binod@latest
```

---

### Option 2: Run from Source

1. **Clone the repository**  📥
```
   git clone git@github.com:Smi0001/agent-binod.git
   cd agent-binod
```

<br/>

2. **Install Dependencies** 📦
   - `node` - v22^
   - `anthropic-ai/sdk` - v0.7^
   - `typescript` - v5^

```
npm i

```
<br/>

3. **Configuration** ⚙️
Create a `.env` file with your Anthropic API key, and other repo path & token configurations. Refer `.env.example` for the variables to configure.

4. **Execution** ▶️

   Then run from anywhere inside your project:

```
npm start "Review PR #1 and post comment"
```

> **Tip**: You can give various variations in your prompt, examples are given below under `Usage` title

## <u>How to find the values for the env variables ?</u> 🔑
<br/>

*ANTHROPIC_API_KEY*
1. Go to console.anthropic.com
2. Sign in (or create an account)
3. Click API Keys in the left sidebar
4. Click Create Key, give it a name (e.g. agent-binod-key)
5. Copy the key immediately — it's only shown once

`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
<br/>

**Platform=Gitea**
*GITEA_REPO* — easy, it's just `owner/repo`  from your Gitea URL:
https://git.example.com/owner/repo   →  `GITEA_REPO=owner/repo`
<br/>

GITEA_TOKEN — create an access token in Gitea:

1. Go to your Gitea instance → click your avatar (top-right) → Settings
2. Left sidebar → Applications
3. Under Manage Access Tokens, enter a token name (e.g. agent-binod)
4. Select permissions:
  - Issues → Read & Write (for posting PR comments)
  - Pull Requests → Read (for listing/reading PRs)
5. Click Generate Token and copy it immediately

`GITEA_TOKEN=7cd244f5xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

<br/>


*GITEA_BASE* — your Gitea instance API URL. Always append /api/v1:
https://git.example.com  →  `GITEA_BASE=https://git.example.com/api/v1`

<br/>
<br/>

**Platform=Github**
*GITHUB_REPO* — easy, it's just `owner/repo`  from your GitHub URL:

https://github.com/owner/repo   →  `GITEA_REPO=owner/repo`
<br/>

*GITHUB_TOKEN* — create a Personal Access Token (PAT):
1. Go to github.com → Settings (top-right avatar menu)
2. Scroll down to Developer settings (bottom of left sidebar)
3. Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
4. Click Generate new token (classic)
5. Give it a name (e.g. agent-binod)
6. Select scopes:
  - repo — to read PRs and post comments on private repos
  - public_repo — if the repo is public (lighter permission)
7. Click Generate token and copy it immediately (shown only once)

`GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
<br/>

*BASE_BRANCH* — optional. For a typical GitHub repo it would be something like:
BASE_BRANCH=origin/main

If you leave it blank, the agent still works but local git diffs will fall back to the Gitea default branch, which likely won't exist for a GitHub repo — so local git will fail and it'll fall back to the GitHub API for diffs automatically.

## Usage 💡
Agent Binod will act as a senior programmer who can review codes and post comments (for now). Add new tools and watch him put the CLI on fire 🔥.
- If only one platform is configured, i.e. `GITEA_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`, etc. single token is set in `.env`, Agent Binod is smart enough to pick that as the default platform.
- If you have configured multiple platforms, then you need to inform him. Override anytime with `--platform=gitea` or `--platform=github`.

> Each example below shows both the **global CLI** and **local dev** command.

<br/>

#### List open PRs 📂

```
agent-binod "List all open PRs"
```
```
npm start "List all open PRs"
```
<br/>

#### Review a specific PR 🔍

> **Gitea** - *default platform, if multiple platforms are configured*

```
agent-binod "Review PR #1001 and post the review as comments"
```
```
npm start "Review PR #1001 and post the review as comments"
```

## What's New 🆕

---

### v1.1.1 — Error Handling 🛡️

- **Agent no longer crashes on tool errors** — Each tool call is now wrapped in try/catch. If a tool fails, the error is logged and returned to Claude as `is_error: true` so it can recover and continue the review instead of crashing the whole run.
  ```
  → calling get_pr_comments({"pr_number":1019})
  ← ERROR [get_pr_comments]: Failed to fetch comments for PR #1019: The target couldn't be found.
  ```
- **Safe comments fetch** — `get_pr_comments` validates the API response before calling `.map()`. Gitea error objects (e.g. PR not found, auth failure) now throw a clear message instead of `TypeError: comments.map is not a function`.

---

### v1.1.0 — Large PR Support 📦

- **Multi-pass chunked review** — Large PR diffs are automatically split at file boundaries. Claude fetches each chunk in sequence and accumulates them before writing a full review. No file is ever cut in half.
  > **Note:** Chunking splits only between files, not within a single file. A PR that modifies only one large file will always be reviewed as a single chunk, regardless of `DIFF_MAX_CHARS`.
- **Smart single-call fallback** — If the diff fits within `DIFF_MAX_CHARS`, it's returned in one call with no chunking overhead.
- **Session diff cache** — Full diff is fetched once and served from memory for all subsequent chunk calls. Eliminates redundant `git fetch` + `git diff` per chunk.
- **Git command timeout** — All `execSync` calls (`git fetch`, `git diff`, `git log`) now respect `GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default: 30s) to prevent hanging on slow networks or large repos.
- **Diff logs** — Each `get_pr_diff` call prints to the terminal so you can follow what's happening.

  Small PR (single pass):
  ```
  [diff] fetching PR #42 diff (limit: 20000 chars)
  [diff] source: local git
  [diff] total size: 8500 chars
  [diff] single pass (fits within limit)
  ```

  Large PR (chunked, multiple files):
  ```
  [diff] fetching PR #42 diff (limit: 20000 chars)
  [diff] source: local git
  [diff] total size: 85000 chars
  [diff] chunk 1/5 (19800 chars)
  [diff] PR #42 served from cache (85000 chars)
  [diff] chunk 2/5 (18200 chars)
  ...
  ```

  API fallback (local git unavailable — no upstream remote, wrong `BASE_BRANCH`, timeout, etc.):
  ```
  [diff] fetching PR #42 diff (limit: 20000 chars)
  [diff] local git failed (Command failed: git fetch upstream ...), falling back to github API
  [diff] source: github API
  [diff] total size: 8500 chars
  [diff] single pass (fits within limit)
  ```

  API fallback due to timeout (`GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` exceeded):
  ```
  [diff] fetching PR #42 diff (limit: 20000 chars)
  [diff] local git failed (spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT), falling back to github API
  [diff] source: github API
  [diff] total size: 8500 chars
  [diff] single pass (fits within limit)
  ```

---

### v1.0.3 — Diff Configuration 🔧

- **Configurable diff limit** — `DIFF_MAX_CHARS` controls the chunk size and chunking threshold (default: 20000, safe up to ~100000).
- **Noisy file filtering** — Configure `DIFF_SKIP_FILES` in `.env` to skip lock files, generated files, and build output from diffs (e.g. `package-lock.json,dist/,*.min.js`).

---

### v1.0.2 — Global CLI ⚡

- **Install globally** — `npm install -g @smi0001/agent-binod` and run from anywhere as `agent-binod "..."`.
- **Fixed Node v18 compatibility** — Replaced `--env-file` flag (Node v20+ only) with `dotenv`, making the tool work on Node v18+.
- **`.npmignore`** — Added explicit publish rules to keep `.env`, `.claude/`, and dev files out of the npm package.

---

### v1.0.1 — GitHub Platform Support 🐙

- **GitHub integration** — Full support for GitHub PRs alongside Gitea.
- **Auto platform detection** — Agent auto-selects the platform based on which token is configured in `.env`. Override with `--platform=github` or `--platform=gitea`.
- **`PR_FETCH_LIMIT`** — Configurable max open PRs to fetch per listing (default: 50).
- **Env validation** — Exits early with a clear error if required env variables are missing for the selected platform.
